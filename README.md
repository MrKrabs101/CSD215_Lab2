# Activity Planner and Game Filter

This F# project models a versatile domain for planning activities and filtering games based on context. While originally inspired by playful scenarios like Valentine’s Day, the structure is generalized and flexible enough to support broader use cases—including game recommendation engines, outing plans, or leisure-time optimizers.

## Game Filtering Feature

This project also lays the groundwork for a filter-based system that can recommend suitable board games based on selected activities or preferences. While filtering logic isn’t hardcoded yet, the domain is already set up to support this next step.
